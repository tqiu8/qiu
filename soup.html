            This project explores the form of light installation and data visualization as mediums to tell a story of human connection. Crowdsourcing and visualizing data allows 
            for the transformation and anonymization of personal stories into abstract points portrayed relative to the thousands of other data points generated by thousands of
            others friends, family members, acquaintances, and strangers. In a world with increased connectivity and accessibility that has commodified our most private experiences, 
            we have drifted farther than ever from each other. Some might argue that we have forgotten what it means to be human and that we have become so pre-occupied with 
            tearing each other apart that we have forgotten to listen to not only others, but ourselves as well.

            My body of work is two-fold. First the microscopic: a probing investigation into the inner desires and fears of each person. Second, the macroscopic: a large 
            light-installation that will transform and project each experience relative to all of the others in real-time, so that each time a new experience is added all 
            of the others must readjust and re-configure. I’ve chosen the form of light for all of the metaphors that it represents: illumination, enlightenment, and truth. 
            It is the most poignant form of communication in its color, radiance, and warmth.
